Now that we've got the tools we need to create and save an image, and
a base framework to build additional functionality on top of, let's turn to
the next important part of a graphics library: being able to draw something
on to the image.

Let's start very simple, with the humble straight line.

`cairo` provides two functions for drawing a straight line:

* `cairo_line_to`
* `cairo_rel_line_to`

Each takes two arguments, floats representing the _x_ and _y_ coordinates of
the destination point. The difference lies in how they translate those
coordinates, and that difference is quite possibly revealed by the names of the
functions. `cairo_line_to` draws a line to the given coordinates interpreted in
absolute space, while `cairo_rel_line_to` interprets the given coordinates as
deltas to be applied relative to the origin point.

Speaking of origin points, you'll have noticed that each of these functions
takes only one set of coordinates, the end point of the line. So how do we know
where to start drawing?

As part of its state, the in-memory Cairo context keeps a record of its "current
point". This point starts out at (0, 0), and is updated every time a line (or
other shape) is drawn on the image surface, or by using two related functions:
`cairo_move_to` and `cairo_rel_move_to`. As you might imagine, these act much
the same way as the `_line_to` functions above, but simply update the "current
point" without rendering a line onto the surface.

Two other functions it will be useful to know about before diving into
implementing this functionality in `Xairo`, are `cairo_stroke` and `cairo_fill`.
These are used to complete a path built of `_line_to`, `_move_to` and other
related functions, and then render it to the image surface either by rendering
the path as a single line, or attempting to fill in the path, respectively.
These functions are related to `paint` which we already saw implemented in a
previous post. For now, though, since we're only drawing straight lines, we'll
only worry about `_stroke`.

So let's look at the functions we need to implement. For now, let's leave aside
the `_rel_*_to` functions, since their implementation will be very close to the
absolute coordinate functions, and also `_fill`, since it will be a very small
and predictable variation on `_stroke`. So that leaves us with:

* `line_to`
* `move_to`
* `stroke`

### On the Elixir side

In C and Rust, the `line_to` and `move_to` functions take 2 arguments, the _x_
and _y_ coordinates as floats. This is fine, and we could implement
`Xairo.line_to` and `Xairo.move_to` to take 2 arguments (in addition to the
image resource) without an problem. But in order to make `Xairo` as
user-friendly as possible, wouldn't it be nice to provide, through
function signatures, some context for those two floats? What if we wrap them in
a very simple `Point` struct?

```elixir
defmodule Xairo.Point do
  defstruct [:x, :y]

  def new(x, y) do
    %__MODULE__{
      x: x * 1.0,
      y: y * 1.0
    }
  end
end
```

then we can write `Xairo.line_to` and `Xairo.move_to`, which take a single,
contextualized, `Point` rather than two unmarked float values.

Now we have a choice. We can either have our NIF for `line_to` accept _x_ and
_y_, and unpack the `Point` in `Xairo.line_to`, or we could keep that context
through the NIF into Rust, and unpack the coordinates only when it's time to
pass them into `cairo`. I prefer the second option, maintaining struct contexts
as much as possible through the API code, both in Elixir and Rust, and
unwrapping them only when it's necessary to communicate with the original C API.

This means that for `Xairo.line_to` the code we write in Elixir, along with the
`Point` struct definition from above, looks like

```elixir
defmodule Xairo.Native do
  ...
  def line_to(_image, _point), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
end

defmodule Xairo do
  ...
  def line_to(%Image{} = image, Point{} = point) do
    Xairo.Native.line_to(image.reference, point)
    image
  end
end
```

How cool is that? Barely any code at all. As we'll see next, things are pretty
much the same over in Rust

### On the Rust side

In the Ruby code above, we saw that instead of passing two floats into Rust
as the coordinates, we're passing an Elixir struct that we've created. As I
alluded to in an earlier post,[^1] `rustler` actually makes passing structured
data between Elixir and Rust very simple by providing a `NifStruct` trait. So we
define our Rust struct

```rust
#[derive(Copy,Clone,Debug,NifStruct)]
#[module = "Xairo.Point"]
pub struct Point {
    pub x: f64,
    pub y: f64
}
```

We derive the `NifStruct` trait and add an annotation matching it to the
struct's name in Elixir, and that is all we have to do to be able to use
the struct directly in our NIF

```rust
#[rustler::nif]
fn line_to(context: WrapperRA, point: Point) -> WrapperRA {
    context.context.line_to(point.x, point.y);
    context
}
```

We implement `move_to` and `stroke` in the same way, and then we should be able
to draw some lines on our image, right?

Well, just about. Except for `paint`, none of our functions deal with color. So
how to do we tell `cairo` what color to use when it draws a line?

Our NIF for `paint` cheated just a little bit by wrapping two `cairo` functions
togther. It calls `set_source_rgb` *and* `paint`. This was fine a little while
ago because we only had one function that could render color on to the canvas.
But now we're adding more, so let's surface `set_source_rgb` out into its own
NIF.[^2] While we're at it, let's provide an `RGB` struct context for those
values like we did with `Point`. The implementation of this struct in Elixir
and Rust will be left as an exercise for the reader.

At the end of this, our `Xairo` Elixir module looks like

```elixir
defmodule Xairo do
  ...
  def line_to(%Image{} = image, Point{} = point) do
    Xairo.Native.line_to(image.reference, point)
    image
  end

  def move_to(%Image{} = image, Point{} = point) do
    Xairo.Native.move_to(image.reference, point)
    image
  end

  def set_source_rgb(%Image{} = image, %RGB{} = rgb) do
    Xairo.Native.set_source_rgb(image.reference, rgb)
    image
  end

  def paint(%Image{} = image) do
    Xairo.Native.paint(image.reference)
    image
  end

  def stroke(%Image{} = image) do
    Xairo.Native.stroke(image.reference)
    image
  end
```

and Rust like
```rust
#[rustler::nif]
fn line_to(context: WrapperRA, point: Point) -> WrapperRA {
    context.context.line_to(point.x, point.y);
    context
}

#[rustler::nif]
fn move_to(context: WrapperRA, point: Point) -> WrapperRA {
    context.context.move_to(point.x, point.y);
    context
}

#[rustler::nif]
fn set_source_rgb(context: WrapperRA, rgb: RGB) -> WrapperRA {
    context.context.set_source_rgb(rgb.red, rgb.green, rgb.blue);
    context
}

#[rustler::nif]
fn paint(context: WrapperRa) -> WrapperRa {
    context.context.paint().unwrap();
    context
}

#[rustler::nif]
fn stroke(context: WrapperRa) -> WrapperRa {
    context.context.stroke().unwrap();
    context
}
```

A nice 1-to-1 mapping of the API, with our structured data kept contextualized
until it needs to be destructed to pass to the native API.

Let's end by putting it all together and drawing an empty white image with two
horizontal black lines:

```elixir
Xairo.Image.new(100, 100)
|> Xairo.set_source_rgb(RGB.new(255, 255, 255))
|> Xairo.paint()
|> Xairo.set_source_rgb(RGB.new(0, 0, 0))
|> Xairo.move_to(Point.new(20, 20))
|> Xairo.line_to(Point.new(80, 20))
|> Xairo.move_to(Point.new(20, 80))
|> Xairo.line_to(Point.new(80, 80))
|> Xairo.stroke()
|> Xairo.save_image("lines.png")
```

and that gives us

![lines.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/xairo/lines.png)

just as we hoped

Next time we'll look at some of that duplication creeping into `Xairo`, and talk
about next steps for the library. Thanks for reading!

#### Footnotes

[^1]: In that previous post, I decided against using this option because of the
complexity of the data we wanted to pass in the struct. Here, where we're only
passing two floating point numbers, it is much simpler. (for the Rust-ier among
you, this approach is possible as long as the field types all implement the
`Copy` trait.)

[^2]: We *could* implement `stroke` (and later, `fill`) similarly, where they
take the color and set it before rendering. Because of how `cairo` works under
the hood, you can set the color at any point during a path's creation/extension
as long as it's before you call `stroke`. But, from a workflow perspective,
it is more natural when drawing to select the color first, so being able to
separate these functions lends itself to a more familiar workflow when using
`Xairo`.
